# The relationship (correlation or anticorrelation, etc)
# between the initial variables and the principal components ($rotation).
# The values of each sample in terms of the principal components ($x)

# We will now plot our pca. This will provide us with some very useful insights i.e.
# which cars are most similar to each other
