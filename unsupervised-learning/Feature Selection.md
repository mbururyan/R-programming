# Feature Selection in Unsupervised Learning


```R
## Example 1: Filter Methods 
# ---
# We can use the findCorrelation function included in the caret package to create a subset of variabes. 
# This function would allows us to remove redundancy by correlation using the given dataset. 
# It would search through a correlation matrix and return a vector of integers corresponding to the columns, 
# to remove or reduce pair-wise correlations.

```R
# Weights are calculated for each variable and cluster. 
# They are a measure of the relative importance of each variable 
# with regards to the membership of the observations to that cluster. 
# The weights are incorporated into the distance function, 
# typically reducing the distance for more important variables.
# Weights remain stored in the model and we can check them as follows:
# 
round(model$weights*100,2)

```


```R
# Example 4: Feature Ranking
# ---

# OUR CODE GOES BELOW

# We install and load the required packages

path<-"http://bit.ly/FeatureSelectionDataset" 
Dataset<-read.csv(path, sep = ",", dec = ".",row.names = 1)

Dataset<-Dataset[-4] 
str(Dataset)
head(Dataset)

```


```R
# From the FSelector package, we use the correlation coefficient as a unit of valuation. 
# This would be one of the several algorithms contained 
# in the FSelector package that can be used rank the variables.
# ---
# 
Scores <- linear.correlation(medv~., Dataset)
Scores

```


```R
# From the output above, we observe a list containing 
# rows of variables on the left and score on the right. 
# In order to make a decision, we define a cutoff 
# i.e. suppose we want to use the top 5 representative variables, 
# through the use of the cutoff.k function included in the FSelector package. 
# Alternatively, we could define our cutoff visually 
# but in cases where there are few variables than in high dimensional datasets.
# 
# cutoff.k: The algorithms select a subset from a ranked attributes. 
# ---
#
Subset <- cutoff.k(Scores, 5)
as.data.frame(Subset)

```


```R
# We could also set cutoff as a percentage which would indicate 
# that we would want to work with the percentage of the best variables.
# ---
#
Subset2 <-cutoff.k.percent(Scores, 0.4)
as.data.frame(Subset2)

```


```R
# Instead of using the scores for the correlation coefficient, 
# we can use an entropy - based approach as shown below;
# ---
# 
Scores2 <- information.gain(medv~., Dataset)

# Choosing Variables by cutoffSubset <- cutoff.k(Scores2, 5)
# ---
# 
Subset3 <- cutoff.k(Scores2, 5)
as.data.frame(Subset3)

```

The above examples were borrowed from the book - Unsupervised Learning with R Book by Erik RodrÃ­guez Pacheco.
